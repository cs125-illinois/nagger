<strong>We want you to succeed in CS 125!</strong>

If you decide to remain in the class, please consider taking some of the
following steps to improve your CS 125 performance:
<!-- -->
<ul>
  <!-- -->
  <li>Attend our weekly even more practice (EMP) sessions: Mondays from
    5&ndash;7PM in Siebel 1404.
  <!-- -->
  </li>
  <!-- -->
  <li>Schedule a regular time to attend
    <!-- -->
    <a href="https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/resources/#hours">office
      hours</a>
    <!-- -->
    <em>early in the week</em> so that you can receive individualized attention
    from the course staff.
  <!-- -->
  </li>
  <!-- -->
  <li>Post questions on the
    <!-- -->
    <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/">course forum</a>
    <!-- -->
    when you get stuck.
  <!-- -->
  </li>
  <!-- -->
  <li>Come to Geoffrey's office hours: MWF at 11AM in the lounge outside of
    Siebel 0226.
  <!-- -->
  He may be able to help you come up with a strategy to do better in CS 125.
  <!-- -->
  </li>
  <!-- -->
</ul>
<!-- -->
</p>

<p>
<!-- -->
<strong>No matter how you do it, please find a way to get help.</strong>

Talk to a fellow student, a course assistant, or your TA; come to
<!-- -->
<a href="https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/resources/#hours">office hours</a>;
<!-- -->
or post on the
<!-- -->
<a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/">course forum</a>.
<!-- -->
We really want you to succeed in this course.
<!-- -->
But CS 125 moves fast, and we also don't want you to get farther behind.
